# SeniorProject (BLIND STICK)
This part represents the software component  of this project, it is considered as one of the important parts of this project as it deals  with many components in software development, this part mainly leverages an online database and mobile development so it can obtain real-time data using hardware components, and sending it to the online database which plays the major role in sending data to the mobile application.

Software itself is the set of inductions that tell a computer what to do which makes computer programmable. Basically, there are three kinds of software.

•	System software which provides function such as operation system, and other functionalities such as hardware management, disk management.

•	Programming software which gives the programmers tools, text editor, compilers, debuggers, linkers and integrated development environment which includes all of the previously mentioned parts of programming software.

•	Application software to help users to perform tasks in easy ways such as data management, media player and social interactivity. An example of these applications like those used in shopping on Amazon.com, socializing with Facebook and Relaxing and Enjoying with Google Play Music.

Software development is the process of creating, designing and maintaining applications or other software components, including writing and maintaining source code of the software application.

Software development is running by software developers, software engineers and programmers, most of times these roles overlap and merge.

•	Programmers who write source code to tell computer what to do. Programmers typically interpret instructions from software developers and engineers and use programming languages like python, Java or kotlin to carry them out.

•	Software engineers  is a person who applies the principles of software engineering to the design, development, maintenance, testing of computer software. They use modeling language such as Express (data modeling language) and other tools to come up with solutions that can often be applied to problems in a general way.

•	Software developer is the one who is responsible for the entire development process. He collaborates with the client to create a theoretical design. Software developers provide leadership and technical guidance along every stage of the software development life cycle.
